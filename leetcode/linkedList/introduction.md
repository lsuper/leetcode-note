* **Dummy Node**
    * Consider to add a dummy node at the beginning of linked list, especially when the head node may be changed.
* **Two pointers**
    * In many questions, you probably need two pointers.
    * They can be two pointers from two ends of linked list, or two pointers with different speed when moving on the list.
